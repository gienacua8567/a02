On the contrary, you should strive to find ways and opportunities of being an inspiration to everyone. Of course, this could be easier said than done. The challenges of being bound in a wheelchair is in fact overwhelming especially in regards to being active much less, to exercise. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>You don’t need to have full mobility to experience the health benefits of exercise. If injury, disability, illness, or weight problems have limited your mobility, there are still plenty of ways you can use exercise to boost your mood, ease depression, relieve stress and anxiety, enhance your self-esteem, and improve your whole outlook on life.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>When you exercise, your body releases endorphins that energize your mood, relieve stress, boost your self-esteem, and trigger an overall sense of well-being. If you’re a regular exerciser currently sidelined with an injury, you’ve probably noticed how inactivity has caused your mood and energy levels to sink. This is understandable: exercise has such a powerful effect on mood that it can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medication. However, an injury doesn’t mean your mental and emotional health is doomed to decline. While some injuries respond best to total rest, most simply require you to reevaluate your exercise routine with help from your doctor or physical therapist.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you have a disability, severe weight problem, chronic breathing condition, diabetes, arthritis, or other ongoing illness, you may think that your health problems make it impossible for you to exercise effectively, if at all. Or perhaps you’ve become frail with age and are worried about falling or injuring yourself if you try to exercise. The truth is, regardless of your age, current physical condition, and whether you’ve exercised in the past or not, there are plenty of ways to overcome your mobility issues and reap the physical, mental, and emotional rewards of exercise.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>As well as the physical challenges you face, you may also experience mental or emotional barriers to exercising. It’s common for people to feel self-conscious about their weight, disability, illness, or injury, and want to avoid working out in public places. Some older people find that they’re fearful about falling or otherwise injuring themselves.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Don’t focus on your mobility or health issues. Instead of worrying about the activities you can’t enjoy, concentrate on finding activities that you can.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The more physical challenges you face, the more creative you’ll need to be to find an exercise routine that works for you. If you used to enjoy jogging or cycling, for example, but injury, disability, or illness means that they’re no longer options, be prepared to try new exercises. With some experimenting, it’s very possible that you’ll find something you enjoy just as much.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Be proud when you make the effort to exercise, even if it’s not very successful at first. It will get easier the more you practice.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>As a wheelchair user, getting active will bring you important health benefits and can help you manage daily life, too. It’s important to remember that any type of exercise will offer health benefits. Mobility issues inevitably make some types of exercise easier than others, but no matter your physical situation, you should aim to incorporate three different types of exercise into your routines:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Cardio
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Cardiovascular exercises that raise your heart rate and increase your endurance. These can include walking, running, cycling, dancing, tennis, swimming, water aerobics, or “aqua jogging”. Many people with mobility issues find exercising in water especially beneficial as it supports the body and reduces the risk of muscle or joint discomfort. Even if you’re confined to a chair or wheelchair, it’s still possible to perform cardiovascular exercise.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Chair aerobics, a series of seated repetitive movements, will raise your heart rate and help you burn calories, as will many strength training exercises when performed at a fast pace with a high number of repetitions. In fact, any rapid, repetitive movements offer aerobic benefits and can also help loosen stiff joints.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Wrap a lightweight resistance band under your chair (or bed or couch, even) and perform rapid resistance exercises, such as chest presses, for a count of one second up and two seconds down. Try several different exercises to start, with 20 to 30 reps per exercise, and gradually increase the number of exercises, reps, and total workout time as your endurance improves.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Simple air-punching, with or without hand weights, is an easy cardio exercise from a seated position, and can be fun when playing along with a Nintendo Wii or Xbox 360 video game.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Many swimming pools and health clubs offer pool-therapy programs with access for wheelchair users. If you have some leg function, try a water aerobics class.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Some gyms offer wheelchair-training machines that make arm-bicycling and rowing possible. For a similar exercise at home, some portable pedal machines can be used with the hands when secured to a table in front of you.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you want to add competition to your workouts, several organizations offer adaptive exercise programs and competitions for sports such as basketball, track and field, volleyball, and weightlifting.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Strength
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Strength training exercises involve using weights or other resistance to build muscle and bone mass, improve balance, and prevent falls. If you have limited mobility in your legs, your focus will be on upper body strength training. Similarly, if you have a shoulder injury, for example, your focus will be more on strength training your legs and core.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Many traditional upper body exercises can be executed from a seated position using dumbbells, resistance bands, or anything that is weighted and fits in your hand, like soup cans.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Perform exercises such as shoulder presses, bicep curls, and triceps extensions using heavier weights and more resistance than you would for cardio exercises. Aim for two to three sets of 8 to 12 repetitions for each exercise, adding weight and more exercises as your strength improves.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Resistance bands can be attached to furniture, a doorknob, or your chair. Use these for pull-downs, shoulder rotations, and arm and leg-extensions.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Flexibility
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Flexibility exercises help enhance your range of motion, prevent injury, and reduce pain and stiffness. These may include stretching exercises and yoga. Even if you have limited mobility in your legs, for example, you may still benefit from stretches and flexibility exercises to prevent or delay further muscle atrophy.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you’re in a wheelchair or have limited mobility in your legs, stretching throughout the day can help reduce pain and pressure on your muscles that often accompanies sitting for long periods. Stretching while lying down or practicing yoga or Tai Chi in a chair can also help increase flexibility and improve your range of motion.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Most yoga poses can be modified or adapted depending on your physical mobility, weight, age, medical condition, and any injury or disability. Chair yoga is ideal if you have a disability, injury, or a medical condition such as arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoporosis, or multiple sclerosis. Similarly, seated versions of Tai Chi exercises can also be practiced in a chair or a wheelchair to improve flexibility, strength, and relaxation.
